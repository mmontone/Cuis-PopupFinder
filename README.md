# QuickFinder

This is a variation of [Cuis Finder](https://github.com/npapagna/cuis-finder) by Nicolas Papagna, that uses a popup morph as user interface.

Finder is a system-wide search tool for Cuis Smalltalk.

You can use it to search for classes, methods, senders, implementors, system categories... you name it!

It is inspired by Pharo's Spotter and the search feature provided by JetBrains tools, such as IntelliJ IDEA.
